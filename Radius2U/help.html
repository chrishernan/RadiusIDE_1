Double-clicking on a prototype block sends that block, in an animated way, to the "swoop target."

<p>
A red line at bottom of block means that the block is the swoop target.
Further work is needed on determining best swoop target, and/or enabling the user to change the swoop target.

<p>
Entering text in command parameter areas needs further study and work.  Horizontal scroll bar seems awkward.  Pressing Return leads to multiple lines, which is not handled correctly.
Tab order from one parm (for example, in 'if' or 'assign') to another doesn't work correctly.

<p>
Many problems with 'else' exist.
A second else can be attached to if  -- fixed, I think, but needs further testing.

<p>
Shift-click on background toggles box visibility.  This is an experiment, to see whether the text by itself is readable and visually attractive.  (Right now it isn't.)

<p>
Holding and dragging the mouse creates a selection box. Blocks inside (partially or completely) the selection box are selected.

<p>
Ctrl-C copies selected blocks and boxes to a buffer. 
Ctrl-V inserts a copy of these blocks and buffers into the programming pane.

<p>
Known bug: serialization and deserialization will not work correctly if a parameter has a new line in it, or the string '//.'.
